To maximize the chance of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50, so the middle value would be around the average of 1 and 50.

The average of 1 and 50 is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest integer, which is 26 (rounding 25.5 up).

26
