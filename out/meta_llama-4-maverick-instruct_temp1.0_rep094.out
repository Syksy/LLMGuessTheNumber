To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the middle of the range given, as this is a common strategy in binary search approaches. The range is 1 to 50, so the middle number is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest whole number.
