To maximize the chance of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50.

The middle number between 1 and 50 is calculated as (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 26.
