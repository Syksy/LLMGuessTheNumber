To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the middle of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50, so the middle value would be around 25 or 26. 

Since the range is inclusive and there are 50 numbers in total (an even count), there's no single middle number, but rather two middle numbers (25 and 26). Both are equally good choices. I'll opt for 26.

26
