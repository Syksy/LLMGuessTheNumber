To maximize my chances, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range, as this gives me the best chance of being close or exactly correct if your number is randomly chosen. The range is between 1 and 50.

The middle number between 1 and 50 is calculated as (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we are dealing with integers, I'll choose 25 or 26. Both are equally likely to be correct, but I'll pick one.

26
