To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the midpoint of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50, so the midpoint is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest integer, which is 26, but to simplify, I can directly choose a number that is central or use a straightforward approach.
