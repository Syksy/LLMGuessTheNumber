To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range, as this gives me the best chance of being correct given the lack of additional information. The range is 1 to 50, so the middle value is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest integer, which is 26, but to be more precise in my guess without bias towards the lower or higher end, either 25 or 26 would be a reasonable choice. Let's go with 25.
