To maximize the chance of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range. Since the range is between 1 and 50, the middle value would be around the average of 1 and 50.

The average is calculated as (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. The closest integer to 25.5 is 25 or 26. I'll pick one of these.

26
