To maximize my chances, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the range you've given. The range is 1 to 50, so the middle value is around (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. I'll round this to the nearest integer, which is 26, but since we're dealing with a range that includes both 25 and 26 as middle-ish values, either could be a reasonable guess. I'll go with 25.

25
