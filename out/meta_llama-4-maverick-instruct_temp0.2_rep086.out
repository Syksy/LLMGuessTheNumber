To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the middle of the given range, but since I only get one guess, I'll actually just pick a number at random or use a strategy that doesn't rely on getting feedback. The range is 1 to 50, so a reasonable guess could be the midpoint or a number chosen based on some probability distribution.

Given the range is 1-50, a straightforward guess is 25 or 26 since they are near the middle. Let's go with 26.
