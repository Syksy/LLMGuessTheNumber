To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range, as this is a common strategy in guessing games when you have no additional information. The range given is 1 to 50.

The middle number between 1 and 50 is calculated as (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 26 (though both 25 and 26 would be reasonable choices, I slightly favor 26 due to the nature of rounding).
