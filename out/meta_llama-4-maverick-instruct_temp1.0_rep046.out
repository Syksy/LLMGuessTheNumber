To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, we should choose a strategy that gives us the best odds. Since we're dealing with a range of numbers (1 to 50) and we only get one guess, the optimal strategy isn't about finding a "likely" number based on probability distributions (since we don't have any information suggesting the distribution isn't uniform), but rather understanding that every number has an equal chance.

Given that, the simplest and most straightforward approach is to pick a number right in the middle of the range. This isn't necessarily because it's more likely to be correct (since each number is equally likely), but it's a reasonable and intuitive choice.

The range is 1 to 50, so the middle number is the average of 1 and 50.

(1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5

Since we're dealing with integers, we can round this to either 25 or 26. Both are equally valid choices.

Let's go with 25.
