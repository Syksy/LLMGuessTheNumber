To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the midpoint of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50, so the midpoint is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, I'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 25 or 26. Both are equally valid choices, but I'll pick one.

26
