To maximize the chance of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number roughly in the middle of the given range. The range is between 1 and 50.

The optimal first guess in a binary search (which is essentially what we're doing here) is the middle number. 

For the range 1 to 50, the middle number is calculated as: (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5. Since we're dealing with integers, we'll round this to the nearest integer.

25.5 rounded to the nearest integer is 26.

So, my guess is: 
26
