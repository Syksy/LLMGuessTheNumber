Alright, let's tackle this problem methodically. The goal is to guess a random integer between 1 and 50 with only one chance to get it right. Since the number is random, every number in that range has an equal probability of being the correct one. 

### Understanding the Problem

First, let's understand the parameters:

- **Range of numbers:** 1 to 50 (inclusive)
- **Random selection:** Each number has an equal chance (1/50) of being selected
- **Single guess:** Only one attempt to guess the correct number

Given that we have only one guess, we want to maximize our chances of being correct, or at least make the most informed guess possible. 

### Possible Strategies

1. **Random Guess:** Since the number is random, choosing any number within the range gives a 1/50 chance of being correct. There's no inherent advantage to any particular number unless we have additional information, which we don't in this case.

2. **Middle Number:** Some might think to pick the middle of the range (e.g., 25 or 26) because it's central, but since the selection is uniformly random, this doesn't increase the probability of being correct.

3. **Psychological Guess:** Humans are not truly random; if a person is picking a "random" number, they might lean towards certain numbers (like multiples of 5, odd numbers, etc.). However, since the problem states it's a random integer (and assuming it's uniformly random), this might not apply here.

4. **Choosing a Fixed Number:** Given no additional information, always guessing the same number (say, 25) every time doesn't change the probability; it's still 1/50. Over many trials, this is as good as any other number.

Given that all numbers are equally likely, and without any biases or additional information, no single number gives a better chance than another. 

### Optimal Strategy

Since all numbers between 1 and 50 are equally likely, and we have no way to infer any bias or pattern, the optimal strategy is indeed to pick any number at random. The expected probability of guessing correctly is the same regardless of the number chosen.

Therefore, any number from 1 to 50 is as good as any other. 

### Final Decision

For the sake of this single guess, I'll choose a number that seems as unbiased as possible. Often, people might avoid the very first or last numbers in a range when asked to pick "randomly," but again, that's a human bias. 

I'll choose **23**. It's roughly in the middle, not too high or too low, and doesn't have any obvious patterns that might make it stand out more than other numbers in the given range.

### Answer

23
