Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to try to guess a random integer between 1 and 50 that someone is thinking of. I only get one chance to guess correctly, so I want to make sure my guess is as optimal as possible under the given constraints.

### Understanding the Problem

First, let's restate the problem to ensure I understand it correctly:

- **Range of Numbers**: The number is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- **Randomness**: The number is chosen randomly, which implies that every number in that range has an equal probability of being chosen (uniform distribution).
- **Single Guess**: I have only one attempt to guess the number correctly.
- **Output**: I need to provide the guess as a plain number without any additional text.

Given that the number is chosen uniformly at random, every number from 1 to 50 has a probability of 1/50 of being the correct one. Since I have only one guess, the probability of guessing correctly is 1/50, no matter which number I choose. 

### Is There an Optimal Strategy?

At first glance, it might seem that since the number is random and uniformly distributed, any guess is as good as any other. However, let's think a bit deeper to see if there's a way to maximize the probability or if there's any additional information we can use.

#### Human Bias in Randomness

The problem states that the number is "random," but since a human is thinking of it, it might not be perfectly uniformly random. Humans are bad at generating truly random numbers and often have biases. For example:

1. **Avoidance of Extremes**: People might avoid very high or very low numbers, thinking they're too obvious.
2. **Favoring Certain Numbers**: Numbers like 7, 13, 21, etc., might be more likely due to cultural or personal significance.
3. **Odd vs. Even**: People might prefer odd or even numbers based on subconscious preferences.

However, the problem explicitly says "random integer," so we should assume uniformity unless hinted otherwise. But since no additional information is given, we'll proceed under the assumption that the number is uniformly random.

#### Mathematical Optimality

Under uniform distribution, the expected value and other statistical measures don't help in choosing a single guess, as all numbers are equally probable. Therefore, from a purely mathematical standpoint, any number between 1 and 50 is as good as any other.

### Choosing the Midpoint

A common strategy in such problems, especially when you have multiple guesses (like in binary search), is to start with the midpoint to minimize the maximum possible number of guesses. Here, since we have only one guess, choosing the midpoint doesn't offer any advantage in terms of probability, but it might feel like a "central" or "neutral" choice.

The midpoint between 1 and 50 is:

(1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5

Since we're dealing with integers, we can choose either 25 or 26. Let's go with 25.

But again, this doesn't increase the probability of being correct compared to any other number.

### Psychological Considerations

Given that humans are involved, even if we're told the number is random, some numbers might be more likely to be chosen subconsciously. For instance:

- **Prime Numbers**: People might think primes are more "random."
- **Numbers with Cultural Significance**: Like 7, 12, 21, etc.
- **Middle Numbers**: As mentioned, numbers around the middle might be perceived as less "obvious."

But without data on human number-picking tendencies, this is speculative.

### Conclusion Under Uniform Randomness

Under the assumption that the number is truly uniformly random, the best we can do is pick any number, as all have the same probability. Therefore, the choice is arbitrary. 

### Final Decision

Given that, and since we must pick one number, I'll choose the middle number rounded down, which is 25. 

**Answer:** 25
