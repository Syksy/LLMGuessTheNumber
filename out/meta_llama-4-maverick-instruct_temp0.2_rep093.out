To maximize the chances of guessing correctly, I'll choose a number that is roughly the middle of the given range, but since I only get one guess, I'll actually just pick a number at random or use a strategy that doesn't rely on feedback. A simple strategy is to guess a number that is near the middle of the range.

The range is 1 to 50, so the middle is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5.
